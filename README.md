SineCash is made to be a family IOU tracker. The money in SineCash isn't real, removing the risk of children spending their money on unapproved purchases and also removing the hastle of setting up a bank account for your children. 
<br>

**SETTING UP:** <br>
To set up a SineCash family, just sign up and then click 'parent'. This will take you to a page where you can enter a family name and then press 'create family'. The site will then generate a random four letter code, which will allow children and other adults to join the family. 
To join as a child, sign up and then click 'child'. Then, enter the family code provided by your parent and you will be logged in. 
To add another parent, sign up, click parent, and then type the family code into the field down by the bottom. click the join button.
_Note: you can always delete family members or lock you family, see Family Page section fro more info._

Accepting a request only takes one simple step. On the home page, If someone is requesting from you, an alert will appear near the bottom of your screen asking if you'd like to accept the request. You can press 'yes' to send the money or 'no' to decline their request.
<br>


**TRANSACTION HISTORY\** <br>
By clicking the 'transaction history' button on the home page, you will be taken to a page where you can see ALL of your past transactions. You can also filter by person or transaction type by clicking the filter button in the top right.

Locking the family: If everyone is already in your family, you can check the 'lock family' box and it will disable the ability for people to join your family.

To unlock/lock your family, simply toggle the checkbox to your desired setting, and press submit.

**PROMISE CARDS:** <br>
