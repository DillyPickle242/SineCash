SineCash is made to be a family IOU tracker. The money in SineCash isn't real, removing the risk of children spending their money on unaproved purchases and also removing the hastle of setting up a bank account for your children.

To set up a SineCash family, just sign up and then click 'parent'. This will take you to a page where you can enter a family name and then press 'create family'. The site will then generate a random four letter code, which will allow children and other adults to join the family. 
To join as a child, sign up and then click 'child'. Then, enter the family code provided by your parent and you will be logged in. 
To add another parent, sign up, click parent, and then type the family code into the field down by the bottom. click the join button.
_Note: you can always delete family members or lock you family, see Family Page section fro more info._
